Deliverables produced
---------------------
* 4 R-scripts;
* README.md (this file);
* 4 PNG-files.

How the R-scripts work
----------------------
Each R script loads the relevant data, filtering over the relevant dates while loading. That way, main memory is saved. Then data is re-formatted, dates and
times combined etc. Then, the screen output is produced. Final step is creating the PNG file. Careful: it overwrites and existing file in the working directory
that has the same name.


Please note the following: if you run the script as-is, your working directory will be used for the file operations. Can be changed if you e.g. change the 
working directory directly in the script.
